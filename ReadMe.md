Static Design Maps is a static analysis tool for Java source files.

It is designed to analyse Java source files of a project to identify which classes in a given project are the most significant to the project. The significance of the classes are defined by one or more characterstics of the classes. 
The characteristics (called rules in the source code) are then identified by the user and assigned a weight to each characterstic within an algorithm. This is to allow the user (you) to define what you consider to be an important combination of 

NB there is a default algorithm included to show you how your algorithm should look.

Developed by Ryan J. McNulty, Glasgow as a project for his Bsc Hons disertation.
